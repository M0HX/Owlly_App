List of Unsolved Problems/ Difficult Part
The problems consisted of displayed places for each category. The connection between the listed places and a category was the main problem of our application and the time was mostly spend on that concept. 

Future Enhancement of Owlly Application
The future features of the application aim to enhance the application's appearance and funcitons. The future enhancement is applying a drop down feature for the category to enable the users to navigate the application easily. Adding more categories that represents more entertainment areas in Bahrain. Inserting a search bar to grant simple access to specific places that the viewer might be searching for.
