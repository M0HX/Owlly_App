*Description:*
Owlly is an entertainment application targeting users who want to discover enjoyable locations and activities in Bahrain. Owlly is designed for all audiences, including Bahrainis and tourists seeking entertaining outdoor activities.

*Application Instructions:*
In the Owlly application, users can sign up using their Google account and explore places by browsing through categories to discover Bahrain. The application caters to individuals who want to have a memorable experience. Adding reviews to places allows users to share their enjoyable experiences with others.

Users can click on their username to edit their information, and they can also upload profile pictures from their devices.

Administrators have the ability to log in and make necessary changes, such as adding places with content and uploaded media. Additionally, administrators can add categories and pictures. They also have permission to delete categories, places, and reviews.

*Wireframes:*
Designed wireframes provide a conceptual understanding of the application and its structure. The displayed wireframes include designs for the home page, category details, place details, and reviews.
